"""Fire simulation engine for wildfire spread modeling.

This package provides the core simulation components for modeling wildfire behavior
on a hexagonal grid. It includes the main simulation class, cell representation,
and real-time visualization support.

Classes:
    - FireSim: Main wildfire simulation model with Rothermel fire spread.
    - Cell: Hexagonal cell representing a discrete simulation unit.
    - RealTimeVisualizer: Real-time visualization interface for running simulations.
